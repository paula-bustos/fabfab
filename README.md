giving second life to objects
<p> Welcome to our repo of Fab Academy 1st microchallenge. We are approaching how fabrication tools and design can give new life to objects. Sometimes we discard products because their intial function is broken. This means that the purpose they were created for is now non existent. This shouldn't be like this. Objects as many other things in life can mutate and with that extend their life span. We believe human creativity can achieve this if given the proper tools. For that we want to facilitate people with "easy to use and understand" tools that can shape the way they transform objects.</p>
