      <div class="about-story-wrap">
        <p class="paragraph-light">We came up with this idea when we started recollecting old and discarded furniture from the trash. We couldn&#x27;t believe how people would just throw away pieces of furniture that were capable of functioning correctly after a few adjustments. <br>‍<br>We realized how many things end up in the trash without a purpose anymore rather than just being waste. We want to change that by finding a new meaning for them. We think all objects have a defined purpose but we can transform them in order to find a new one.<br>‍<br>By taking the object out of context and imagining new functions we can help the object mutate and extend its life span. For this we want to lean on digital fabrication in order to design some tools that can make this an easier and enjoyable process.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-4">WHAT FOR</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">We want to develop an adaptable and modular system that can be applied to different types of objects in order to assemble them together and create a new object. By creating this mutations, we wish to give a second life to products and ignite creativity and learning within the users. This adaptable systems can be modified to fit specific objects and necessities accordingly. This modules can be stackable to substitue an object&#x27;s limb or serve as a joint to connect it with another object.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We first wanted to think what were the most common joints people use when fabricating a piece of furniture. Then we thought about what things are usually broken or missing in a discarded object. When looking at other projects and analyzing how they were solving this issues we came to realize it is usually a one piece that is joined by screws into another one. We decided to try and be a bit more playful and come up with a system than can work as a lego and be assembled by hand. This was challenging to make because of the fabrication method we have to use which is laser cutting. We decided to try the assembly method but combine it with screws as well. </p>
